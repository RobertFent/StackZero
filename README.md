# StackZero

**StackZero** is a minimal, full-stack web application template designed for ultra-low-cost SaaS hosting.<br>
Built with simplicity and efficiency in mind, StackZero avoids heavy dependencies and frameworks — focusing instead on clean HTML (via [htmx](https://htmx.org)), modular backend logic, and Docker-based portability.

## 🌱 Philosophy

- 💡 **Zero Stack Bloat** — No frontend frameworks, no TypeScript, no fancy build tools.
- 🧩 **Modular Backend** — All logic lives in `core`, maintained here.
- 🖼️ **Template Frontend** — A generic `app` and `static` folder you can override entirely.
- 🗃️ **Template Database** — A generic `database` folder you can override entirely.
- 🚀 **Simple Deployment** — One `docker-compose.yml` and you're live.
- 💸 **5€ SaaS-Ready** — Designed to run on a 4€ Hetzner VPS + 1€ domain.

## 🐳 Getting Started (Docker)

To get StackZero running locally or in production use [StackZero-Template](https://github.com/RobertFent/StackZero-template):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RobertFent/Stackzero-template.git
cd Stackzero-template
cp -R templates/webpage_new/app/* app/
cp -R templates/webpage_new/data/* data/
cp -R templates/webpage_new/static/* static/
```

Run the local development version:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up
```

Run the production version designed to run on a VPS:

```bash
cp .env-template .env # then paste the proper variables into the .env
docker compose up -d
```

For a more detailed tutorial, check the documentation of the [StackZero-Template](https://github.com/RobertFent/StackZero-template) repository.

## 🔧 Design Principles

- No transpilers: Plain JavaScript (ES Modules), no TypeScript.
- No build step: Static assets served directly.
- No frontend framework: Uses htmx and a custom html.js parser.
- Single process: No multi-service architecture, everything runs in one container.
- Portable: Works on amd64 and arm64 thanks to multi-arch Docker builds.

## 🧠 Core Architecture

The logic behind StackZero lives in core/, structured as internal modules:

- html.js: Custom HTML templating engine
- router.js: Minimal routing and request handler
- database/: SQLite-based persistence and migration
- hasher.js, logger.js, utils.js: Supporting logic
- coreModuleLoader.js: Dynamically loads and registers frontend modules

## 🔒 Security & Isolation

- Users can override the app/ folder via Docker, but cannot access core/
- The core logic is mounted in the image, not the host – source code stays private
- Only a thin public interface (e.g., core_api.js) is exposed to the user app, if needed - feature not supported yet

## 🧰 Minimal Deployment Stack

StackZero is designed to run on:
| Component | Cost |
|---------------|--------------|
| Hetzner VPS | ~4.00 € /mo |
| Domain | ~1.00 € /mo |
| **Total** | **5.00 €** |

Perfect for small tools, prototypes, or self-hosted SaaS products.

## 📦 Example Use Cases
